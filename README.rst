=============
Channels + react stream chat demo
=============

Chat application demo using django + channels + react.

Everything wrapped up in docker so you just build and have fun :).
Check MAKEFILE for different commands to start the application.

The application uses the internal IP so you can chat in LAN with no configuration.

Credits to https://github.com/RubenSousaDinis,
part of the code and architecture of the app are his.
